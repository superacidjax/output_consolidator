This is a small program to consolidate some data files (located in ```/data_files```) into a single results file.

This was developed with Ruby 2.3.0 but was also tested on Ruby 1.9.3-p547.

Rspec 3.4.4 was used for the tests, however other versions of Rspec may work, though there are no guarantees!

To run:

At the command line simply run ```ruby runme.rb```

The results will be outputted into a file called ```results.txt```. If this file exists, it will be overwritten with the latest results

Running the tests:

Typing ```rspec``` at the command line is all you need for green happiness.
